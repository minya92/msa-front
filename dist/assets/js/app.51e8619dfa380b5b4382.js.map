     answer: 'Однозначно можно сказать, что среднестатистический японский секонд-хэнд с исправным двигателем и настроенными карбюраторами \"ходит\" со скоростями до 200 км/ч. Можно добавить, что ограничитель срабатывает обычно в зоне 12-13 тыс. оборотов, что на шестой передаче составляет как раз 185-190 км/ч. Спортбайки со \"оторванными\" ограничителями могут развивать скорость до 220 км/ч (шестая передача, в районе красной зоны тахометра). Но стоит ли говорить, что это предельные параметры, при которых двигатель начинает испытывать дополнительные перегрузки?'\n      }, {\n        problem: 'Практикуется-ли скручивание спидометра на мотоциклах сэкондхенд?',\n        answer: 'Еще как практикуется! Если конечно, спидометр не электронный и информация не хранится в памяти компьютера, однако и ее можно изменить. Никогда не верьте показателям одометра мотоцикла, если ему более 7 лет! Да это и не имеет значения: вы никогда не узнаете, сколько реально проехал байк на родине, в Японии. Примерная цифра указана в ГТД (государственной таможенной декларации), которая всегда прилагается к мотоциклу. Там указана цифра, которая стояла на одометре при пересечении границы. Поставщику выгодно, чтобы цифра была побольше, чтобы платить меньший налог. Однако сразу после попадания мотоциклов в салоны и к частным лицам, заниющимся перепродажей техники ... Вобщем, пройстейший пример: механизм спидометра усторен так, что \"в плюс\" идут \"обратные\" обороты (т.е. против часовой стрелки), когда мотоцикл катится вперед - километраж прибавляется. Многие спидометры не имеют \"возвратки\", которая плюсует и обороты по часовой, и обороты против часовой стрелки. Таким образом, когда вы катите байк задним ходом, километраж уменьшается. Таким образом можно, например, при помощи электродрели \"скрутить\" пару-тройку тысяч км. Однако, простые расчеты показывают, что это занятие займет ... более 10 часов! Поэтому иногда корпус спидометра вскрывается и значение на счетчите выставляется такое, какое хочется видеть продавцу. Некоторые салоны принципиально выставляют пробег равным 0 км, как-бы дополнительно подтверждают высказывание \"БЕЗ ПРОБЕГА ПО РОССИИ\", так как пробег по Японии практически не имеет значения. Европейские же мотоциклы всегда имеют огромный пробег: здесь фишка в том, что европейцы ездят на порядок больше, чем японцы, да и расстояния там побольше. Поэтому не стоит верить \"европейцу\" 1993 года с пробегом 10000 км. 5000 км - это нормальный сезонный пробег для среднего байкера. 10000 - 2 года. А остальные - в гараже стоял?

Можно добавить, что ограничитель срабатывает обычно в зоне 12-13 тыс. оборотов, что на шестой передаче составляет как раз 185-190 км/ч. Спортбайки со \"оторванными\" ограничителями могут развивать скорость до 220 км/ч (шестая передача, в районе красной зоны тахометра). Но стоит ли говорить, что это предельные параметры, при которых двигатель начинает испытывать дополнительные перегрузки?'\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            problem: 'Практикуется-ли скручивание спидометра на мотоциклах сэкондхенд?',\r\n            answer: 'Еще как практикуется! Если конечно, спидометр не электронный и информация не хранится в памяти компьютера, однако и ее можно изменить. Никогда не верьте показателям одометра мотоцикла, если ему более 7 лет! Да это и не имеет значения: вы никогда не узнаете, сколько реально проехал байк на родине, в Японии. Примерная цифра указана в ГТД (государственной таможенной декларации), которая всегда прилагается к мотоциклу. Там указана цифра, которая стояла на одометре при пересечении границы. Поставщику выгодно, чтобы цифра была побольше, чтобы платить меньший налог. Однако сразу после попадания мотоциклов в салоны и к частным лицам, заниющимся перепродажей техники ... Вобщем, пройстейший пример: механизм спидометра усторен так, что \"в плюс\" идут \"обратные\" обороты (т.е. против часовой стрелки), когда мотоцикл катится вперед - километраж прибавляется. Многие спидометры не имеют \"возвратки\", которая плюсует и обороты по часовой, и обороты против часовой стрелки. Таким образом, когда вы катите байк задним ходом, километраж уменьшается. Таким образом можно, например, при помощи электродрели \"скрутить\" пару-тройку тысяч км. Однако, простые расчеты показывают, что это занятие займет ... более 10 часов! Поэтому иногда корпус спидометра вскрывается и значение на счетчите выставляется такое, какое хочется видеть продавцу. Некоторые салоны принципиально выставляют пробег равным 0 км, как-бы дополнительно подтверждают высказывание \"БЕЗ ПРОБЕГА ПО РОССИИ\", так как пробег по Японии практически не имеет значения. Европейские же мотоциклы всегда имеют огромный пробег: здесь фишка в том, что европейцы ездят на порядок больше, чем японцы, да и расстояния там побольше. Поэтому не стоит верить \"европейцу\" 1993 года с пробегом 10000 км. 5000 км - это нормальный сезонный пробег для среднего байкера. 10000 - 2 года. А остальные - в гараже стоял?
